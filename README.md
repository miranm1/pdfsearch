# pdfsearch
This is a simple program that takes tabulated data from a certain page and puts into the console and into a txt file.  This is done by using Regular Expression and MatchCollection.  This program takes in input from user for page number of pdf, and the tabulated data that is to be collected.  It currently takes input for certain pdfs I have been using but can be easily edited for other pdfs.
